#React + Flux + webpack example
I've built this example app to test out Flux architecture. I tried not to rely on any library out there that helps building FLUX(ish) apps neither on examples that over-complicate it making it difficult for who is trying to learn FLUX.

This is a simple example app that consumes Facebook Open graph API to list logged-in user likes. I tried to base on Facebook Flux examples, that are not that helpful as well. But there you have it, a simple example consuming real data through an api.

**Consider changing facebook app-id in `actions/app-actions.js` with one that you create**

##Running the demo
`npm install`

`npm start`
